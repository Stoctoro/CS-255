# Projects 1 and 2

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass, a company that helps people get their driver's liscence by providing study material and/or in-person training. They wanted a web system that managed their storefront, appointment schedule, study material, and customer information.

# What did you do particularly well?

I was able to understand and document the customer's requirements. I wrote about the system as detailed as I could without going into the specifics of implementation.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If there was an area in these documents that I thought needed revision, then I would have already changed them. The only exception is the Gantt chart, which I was unable to implement in LucidChart before I had to turn in the project. Were I asked to create another Gantt chart in the future, I now know not to use LucidChart. While their UML tools are great, I would have an easier time creating a Gantt chart in Microsoft Paint.


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

First, I considered the different types of users. There are several types of users with their own needs. I implemented these differences by creating a "privlege" object type in the system design. That way, different privleges can be created and exposed to different user types. This allows the system to be complex and extendable, allowing any number of users to be served without yet specifiying them. I put so much thought into this because the system is intended to serve the users, the system has no purpose if no users' needs are met.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My first steps are to figure out what I have, what I need, and what must be delivered. I answer these questions, and ask them again on each of the answers. I continue doing this recursively until the answer to all of these questions is the same. This process is not unlike the creation of data flow diagrams. I then go about implementing my answers fromt the lowest level up, until I have a functioning program. However, I will admit that I only really have a experience creating lower level programs so far.
